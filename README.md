**The Stocks project**
 
 This is a sample project for storing Data of Stocks. Indeed I developed everything in this project depending on my time limits and being clear its business logic. First of all, I introduce used technologies in this project:
 
 Java 8
 
 Spring Boot
 
 Spring IOC
 
 Spring AOP
 
 Spring REST
 
 Swagger
 
 Junit
 
 Mockito
 
 Spring boot test
 
 HTML
 
 BootStrap
 
 ReactJS
 
 For running the project please use Maven install command. After running it you can see it's Rest documents on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html# , moreover you can watch it's simple front_end on http://localhost:8080/ .
 
 Indeed I tried to express my some of my skills in a Java based project. Actually I could not find any complicated scenario in its business logic, thus I implemented the project in a very clear and simple way. To be frank, I am not a front-end developer but I tried to show some of my skills on it.  
 

 
 Thank you for your consideration and time. Mohammadreza Mirali
